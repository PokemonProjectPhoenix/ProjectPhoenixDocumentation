title: What is Project Phoenix?
---

**Project Phoenix** is ​​a **_framework_** that aims to allow anyone to develop a Monster Collector game.

Although not being affiliated to _it_, Project Phoenix's objective is to deliver an experience similiar to a _Gen 4_ mainline game,
but still being highly customizable.

:::important

Please remember that being a _framework_, this project will provide you with the **_bare minimum_** assets and a working _skeleton_ for creating a game. This being said, we ask of __you__, our community, to help us. Creating assets and resources and sharing them as _.unitypackages_ will allow the project, the community and the number of developed games to grow bigger.
