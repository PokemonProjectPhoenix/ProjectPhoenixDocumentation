The **Fade Block** allows us to play a black fade transition on the screen.

The **Time** parameter determines how much time we should wait after the fade transition has ended.

The **Target Fade Value** parameter determines what the target value for the fade should be, with:
+ 0 being clear (we see the game).
+ 1 being occluded (we see a black screen).

The **Fade Time** parameter determines how long it should take for the transition to end.
