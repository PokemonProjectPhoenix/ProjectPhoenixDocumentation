The **Choice Block** allows us to display a messsage, control its behaviour and display a choice after it. For informations about the Message customization, please refer to the [Dialogue Block](dialogueevents) documentation.

Using the **Add choice** button we can add as many choices as we want. Each choice will have a *Choice #* parameter which determines the choice number and label, and determines which block should follow after **that choice is selected**.
